Redirected walking must be used with the gaurdian boundary.

There is a yellow tablet which can be grabbed. This tablet is a timer. Press A to start and pause the timer. Press B to reset the timer.

A blue pole is somewhere on the scene. Press the Left Hand Trigger (the one on middle finger) to teleport it to a new random location on the map. 

There is a green path/plank. On one end, there is a floating green ball. Press X to have it move along the path, and press it again to stop it.
Press Y to return it to the beginning of the path.

Within the project itself (in Unity), there are a few options you can change. In the Tracking Space game object, you can toggle what type of rotations you may want to apply.
You can enable/disable the script that shows the Gaurdian boudary. Additionally, in the PathFollower gameobject, you can adjust the speed of the green ball.
